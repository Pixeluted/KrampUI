## Getting KrampUI

### [Download the binary](https://github.com/BitdancerStudios/KrampUI/releases/latest),

### or... compile it yourself!
1. Ensure you have `cargo` (`rustup`), `node`, and `npm` installed.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run start` or `npm run build` depending on what you need.
4. Access the executable at `src-tauri/target/release` or `src-tauri/target/debug`.

## Q&A

### Where is the scripts and autoexec folder?
It's located at ``%appdata%/KrampUI``, or just press the folder icon on the UI and navigate one folder up.

### Ro-Exec updated, how do I select a new loader?
Right click the inject button and press "Select Loader".

### I don't see the UI, how do I fix it?
Perhaps your computer doesn't have Microsoft Edge Webview installed.</br>
Install it from <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2" target="_blank">here</a> (scroll down & install Evergreen Bootstrapper), and see if that fixes your issue.

### It's injected, why is the title gray and the inject button disabled?
You're probably in the Roblox menu, for the UI to recognize it's connected, join a game.

### How to fix it injecting but not executing scripts?
It's probably a issue with Ro-Exec. It's advised to wait until you load into game before injecting.
