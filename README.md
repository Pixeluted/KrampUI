3. Run `npm run start` or `npm run build` depending on what you need.
4. Access the executable at `src-tauri/target/release` or `src-tauri/target/debug`.

## Q&A
### Where is the scripts and autoexec folder?
It's located in the same directory as KrampUI exe is.

### Synapse Z updated, how do I select a new loader?
Simply replace the loader in the directory

### I don't see the UI, how do I fix it?
Perhaps your computer doesn't have Microsoft Edge Webview installed.</br>
Install it from <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2" target="_blank">here</a> (scroll down & install Evergreen Bootstrapper), and see if that fixes your issue.


### How to fix it injecting but not executing scripts?
It's probably a issue with Synapse Z. It's advised to wait until you load into game before injecting.
